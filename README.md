# UFOs
Overview: the purpose of this project was to develop a website that will keep track of ufo sitings. This can potentially be used to locate the geographical area of the sitings, as well as the frequency over time. 
Results: I was able to create a webpage that had the ability to capture dates, States, Country and the appearance of the siting. It also has a button for comments.
Summary: I was not able to complete the code after many hours of trying. The knowledge required to complete this challenge was not provided in the module. Recommendation for the webiste: There is only one page available and it is not clear if the user can see entries made by others. There is no space to upload images, and creating a library in this site would make it more appealing.
